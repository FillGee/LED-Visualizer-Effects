# LED-Visualizer-Effects
Code for the ongoing project of have an LED strip (and maybe a matrix) that has a ton of effects, reacts to music in certain modes, and is controllable via MQTT &amp; IFTTT. A mess of code as I have been learning, adding bits, changing methods of implementation (from Arduino Uno to Teensy 4.0), etc.

As this is really my first major "Arduino" project in 10 years, most of the code I have learned and based off of other LED projects from the community, refrencing the FastLED wiki, and the built in examples. Below is an (incomplete and ever-expanding) list of links I compiled while researching and learning.
