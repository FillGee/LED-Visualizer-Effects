# LED-Visualizer-Effects
Code for the ongoing project of have an LED strip (and maybe a matrix) that has a ton of effects, reacts to music in certain modes, and is controllable via MQTT &amp; IFTTT. A mess of code as I have been learning, adding bits, changing methods of implementation (from Arduino Uno to Teensy 4.0), etc.
